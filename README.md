A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Built using vanilla Javascript and DOM. The player will compete with the computer, and the game will be over as soon as either the player or the computer wins the third round. This is my very first Javascript project; the code may not adhere to the DRY principle, but I wanted to demonstrate my ability in understanding HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Instructions:
1. Open up "RPS.html" in your browser and enjoy!
